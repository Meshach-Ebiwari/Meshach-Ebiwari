- 👋 Hi, I’m @Meshach-Ebiwari
I’m a Design Engineer building scalable fintech, SaaS, AI, and interactive systems with a strong focus on frontend architecture, design systems, and production-ready user interfaces.

I work across the full product lifecycle, from user research and system design to implementation. My approach emphasizes component-driven development, accessibility, performance, and maintainability. I design with engineering constraints in mind and build interfaces that are consistent, scalable, and easy to extend.

Technical focus

Frontend architecture with React, Next.js, and Gatsby
Component libraries and design systems aligned with product requirements
State management, API integration, and edge-case handling
Performance optimization and responsive UI engineering

Tools & stack
Design: Figma, Adobe XD
Frontend: React.js, Next.js, Gatsby, Styled Components
Backend & APIs: Node.js, REST APIs, GraphQL

I’m interested in collaborating on technically challenging products, especially those involving complex systems, scale, and real-world constraints.
